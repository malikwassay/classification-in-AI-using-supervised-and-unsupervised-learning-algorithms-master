# Classification-in-A.I.-using-supervised-and-unsupervised-learning-algorithms

There were given the dataset of cyber attacks and attack types and based on those 2 datasets we were to determine the classification of future attacks.

The problem is mentioned in the included pdf file

The algorithms that were used are:
1. KNN (3,5,7)
2. KMean
3. ANN (Single-layer/ Multi-layer)
4. Clustering
